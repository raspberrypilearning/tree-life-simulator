## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) projects, then try out the next project, [Count the creatures](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/count-the-creatures). In this project, you will create a program to input real data on the range of natural resources used by countries to generate electricity. Then, you will compare the results using animated and interactive data visualisation.

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&curriculum%5B%5D=%201).
