## Introduction

Use Scratch to create a simulation that shows how varying the health of a forest and levels of deforestation impact trees, wildlife and the amount of CO2 absorbed.

This project focuses on three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

+ [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html){:target="_blank"}
+ [Climate Action](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html){:target="_blank"}
+ [Life on Land](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land.html){:target="_blank"}

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Click on the green flag then move the slider to alter the forest health for growing trees and click on the tree feller to request wood. Keep an eye out for natural disasters though - they're very disruptive!
