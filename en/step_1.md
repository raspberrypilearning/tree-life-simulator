## Introduction

Use Scratch to create a simulation that shows the impact of land management and deforestation on trees, wildlife, and the environment.

This project focuses on three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

+ [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#responsible-consumption-and-production){:target="_blank"}
+ [Climate Action](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#climate-action){:target="_blank"}
+ [Life Below Water](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#below-water){:target="_blank"}

Thanks to [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org){:target="_blank"}, for their guidance on tree life simulation.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---

Click on the green flag and then move the slider to alter the tree management levels. Click on the tree feller to request wood. Keep an eye out for natural disasters though — they’re very disruptive!
