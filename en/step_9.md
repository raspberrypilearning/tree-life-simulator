## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) projects, then try out the next project, [Count the creatures](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/count-the-creatures). In this project, you will create a program to input real data on the range of natural resources used by countries to generate electricity. Then, you will compare the results using animated and interactive data visualisation.
